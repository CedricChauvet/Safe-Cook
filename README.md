# Intro
Together with Eric Maresc, we are developing Safe Cook, a mobile application that supports families in their daily food habits. Our solution addresses the concerns of parents who care about their family's nutrition and health by:

* Automatically identifying the food items in your refrigerator using artificial intelligence

* Suggesting recipes tailored to the ingredients you have available

* Taking into account your allergens and dietary restrictions for safe cooking

* Promoting a balanced diet 🍎
